# Threat feeds

### Threat feeds

Threat feeds are streams of information that provide real-time updates on current and emerging security threats. Threat feeds typically include data on the latest malware, vulnerabilities, and other security issues that could pose a risk to an organization's systems and data.

Threat feeds can come from a variety of sources, including government agencies, security vendors, and other organizations that collect and analyze security data. They are often delivered in a machine-readable format, such as XML or JSON, which allows them to be easily integrated into security systems and tools.

Threat feeds can be a valuable source of information for organizations looking to stay informed about the latest security threats and to proactively protect their systems and data. By subscribing to threat feeds and integrating them into their security processes, organizations can gain real-time visibility into emerging threats and take steps to mitigate those threats before they can cause harm.

It important to understand threat feeds are not intelligence, they are data feeds, and often without the context of why the data is in the feed.\
It up to the analysis to take the data and use it an assessment.

If you ingest it into a SIEM or similar solution it important to look for it once and then throw it away.\
Every information relevance, you gain from a feed is time-bound.\
Which is way it better to create detection rules that covers a large variety of attacks

Before acquiring an threat feed you need to understand why you need it, and how it relates to you.\
It important to be critical when selecting these threat feeds.

One of the key questions to ask before acquiring is to ask about the source of the information.\
E.g if you are an company operating in Europe and the feed is from company in asia. The data might not be relevant to you.

Good way to start with threat feed is using open source like DShield, if you do not know how to handle it, you are not ready for the next level. One of the key question to ask about threat feed is the data source of the feed.
