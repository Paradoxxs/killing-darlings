**Multi-model thinking**
The idea of multi-model thinking is quite straightforward it is about taking advantage of utilizing multiple models and analytic methods to try and understand a problem. The idea is to think about models as different perspectives and recognizing that a single method might not be enough we need to view the same information from multiple perspectives to get the full value of the information. This approach is used to predict the outcome of the next flu season, the method utilized by CDC uses $21$, different models.\
The same idea can be applied to any investigation allowing the detective to build a more comprehensive picture of the case, by viewing the evidence from multiple perspectives allow one to identify any gaps of information needed to complete the analysis.\
It allows investigators to consider multiple perspectives and build a more comprehensive understanding. Leading to better decision-making, and effective investigation strategies, ultimately, a clearer picture of the truth.
