# Traffic light protocol

### Traffic light protocol (TLP)

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a set of standardized guidelines for sharing sensitive or classified information among organizations. It is designed to allow organizations to share information in a controlled and secure manner, while still enabling the free flow of information among authorized parties.

TLP uses a color-coded system to designate the level of sensitivity or classification of the information being shared. The four levels of TLP are:

Red: The most sensitive level of information. This information should only be shared with a very limited number of people on a strict need-to-know basis.

Amber: The next level of sensitivity. This information should be shared with a larger group of people who have a legitimate need to know, but only on a need-to-know basis.

Green: The least sensitive level of information. This information can be shared freely with anyone who has a legitimate need to know.

White: The lowest level of sensitivity. This information is considered to be publicly available and can be shared freely with anyone.

The TLP guidelines specify the conditions under which information can be shared at each level, as well as the processes and procedures for sharing the information securely. This helps to ensure that sensitive or classified information is handled in a responsible and secure manner.

TLP is a defined standard for how freely threat intel can be shared.\
You can then label the intelligence with any of the colors in the standard. It will then tell the recipient if the information may be shared.\
It should be noted that TLP is not an legal standard, you can not take anyone in court of breaking the standard. If you really want to have legal hold you should back it up with an NDA.
