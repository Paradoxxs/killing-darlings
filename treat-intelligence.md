## Treat intelligence

Cyber threat intelligence is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about potential cyber threats in order to inform decision making and protect against those threats. Cyber threat intelligence can include information about known or potential cyber attacks, vulnerabilities in software or hardware, or other cyber security risks. It can also include information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers, as well as their motivations and objectives. Cyber threat intelligence is often used by organizations to prioritize their defenses and allocate resources more effectively. It can be used to inform security policies and procedures, as well as to develop and implement appropriate countermeasures. Cyber threat intelligence can be obtained from a variety of sources, including government agencies, private companies, and open-source information.

The goal of threat intelligence is to gather, evaluate and analysis data related to an foreign actor.\
With the intent to get better insight to the mindset of the person or more precisely the tactic technique and procedure (TTP). This will allow policy makers can make better decisions on how to mitigate risk that they pose.\
Or more simple put analyzed information about hostile intent, capability and opportunity of an adversary.\
The focus is on the threat.

### Threat actor

Threat actor is a general term for a person or entity responsible for a cyber attack that impacts the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's assets. Most often, the term is used to describe individuals and groups that conduct malicious acts against organizations. These threat actors can be categorized as either unintentional or intentional, and internal or external.

A threat actor is an individual, group, or organization that has the capability and intent to carry out a cyber attack or other malicious activity. Threat actors can be motivated by a variety of factors, such as financial gain, political objectives, or simply the desire to cause harm.

Threat actors can take a variety of forms, such as state-sponsored hackers, organized crime groups, or lone individuals. They can use a wide range of tools and techniques to carry out their attacks, such as malware, exploits, or social engineering.

In the context of cyber security, threat actors are a major concern, as they can pose a significant risk to organizations and individuals. By understanding the capabilities and intentions of different threat actors, organizations can better defend against potential attacks and mitigate the risks that they face.
