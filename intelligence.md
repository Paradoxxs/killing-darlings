# Intelligence

### Counterintelligence

Counterintelligence is the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about the activities and capabilities of foreign intelligence organizations and individuals. The goal of counterintelligence is to protect national security by identifying and neutralizing the efforts of foreign intelligence organizations to collect sensitive information, and to prevent the loss or compromise of sensitive information to foreign powers. This can involve a variety of activities, such as surveillance, disinformation, and sabotage. Counterintelligence is typically carried out by specialized agencies within the intelligence community, such as the FBI in the United States.

The purpose of counterintelligence is to identify, assess, neutralize and exploitation.\
The intelligence activities of an adversary.



## Analysis

### Timeline analysis

Timeline analysis, works by plotting all event in a sequence by time. To help identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the events. Performing timeline analysis involves the following steps:

1. Develop a timeline: Create a timeline of the all the events. It should include the date and time of each event, and a description of the event.
2. Identify patterns and trends: Involves looking for recurring events, clusters of events, or other patterns that may suggest underlying causes or implications of the events.
3. Develop conclusions and insights: Use the results of the analysis to develop insights and conclusions about the underlying causes and implications of the sequence of events. This can involve identifying key factors that are driving events, making predictions about future developments, or providing recommendations for action.

### Competing hypotheses

The goal of competing hypotheses is to identify and evaluate all of the plausible explanations (hypotheses) for a given situation or event, and to select the most likely explanation based on the available data.

Competing hypotheses involves the following steps:

1. Identify all of the plausible explanations for the event: This can involve brainstorming with other analysts, reviewing existing theories or hypotheses, or using other techniques to generate a comprehensive list of possible explanations.
2. Develop a hypothesis statement for each explanation: A hypothesis statement is a concise and specific statement that describes the key elements of an explanation, which can be tested against the available evidence.
3. Evaluate the evidence for each explanation: Determine what explanations are supported by the data and which are not. This can involve a variety of techniques, such as statistical analysis, network analysis, or geospatial analysis.
4. Select the most likely explanation: The final step is to select the most likely explanation based on the available evidence. This decision should be based on a thorough and systematic evaluation of the evidence, and should be supported by the results of the analysis.

You can use a matrix to display all the possible hypothese and then what evidence rejects or confirms the hypothesis:

\+ : Consistence with evidence\
\- : Inconsistence with evidence

| Evidence                                              | Hacker stealing data | Insider selling information |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Information on the dark web                           | +                    | -                           |
| Quotes and consistently beaten on price               | +                    | +                           |
| High amount of network traffic to unknown destination | +                    | -                           |
