# Threat modeling

### Threat modeling

Threat modeling is a process for identifying and analyzing potential security threats to a computer system, network, or software application. The goal of threat modeling is to identify vulnerabilities in a system and to provide a framework for addressing those vulnerabilities in a systematic and proactive way.

To perform threat modeling, you typically follow these steps:

1. Identify the assets that need to be protected, such as data, hardware, and software.
2. Identify the potential threats to those assets, such as malware, unauthorized access, and natural disasters.
3. Analyze the likelihood and impact of each potential threat.
4. Identify potential countermeasures to mitigate the risks posed by each threat.
5. Prioritize the countermeasures based on their effectiveness and cost.
6. Implement the selected countermeasures and monitor their effectiveness over time.

Threat modeling can be a useful tool for organizations of all sizes to help protect their systems and data from security threats. It is important to regularly review and update a threat model as the organization and its systems evolve to ensure that it remains effective.

Threat modeling is the analysis the design of a systems. To identify potential risk to security and privacy.

The purpose of performing threat modelling is to identify what can go wrong in a system by pinpointing design and implementation issue, that needs mitigation. Weather is it early in the acquirement processes or through-out it life-cycle. The output of the threat model informs decisions that you make in subsequent design, development, testing and post-deployment phases

1. Trust boundaries; location where trust or security changes
2. Data flow path; movement of data between two points
3. Input points; external input is received
4. Privileged operations; any actions that required greater privileged then standard users
5. Details about security stance and approach; declaration of security policy, security foundations and security assumptions.
