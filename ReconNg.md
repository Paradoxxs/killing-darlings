### ReconNg

[Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng) is an open-source command-line tool built with the same modular mindset as Metasploit. Created as a reconnaissance framework, Recon-ng allows for quick and automated OSINT performance. The workspace function enables the separation of case data by having a database for each workspace.
